I have tested server and client with a friend from Computer Engineering in Thai-Nichi Institute of Technology.

### Requirements
- python version more than or equal 3

### To use this protocol
Run socket-server.py on server side first

For server side:
in project directory
`>python socket-server.py`
And wait for client side to communicate with you...

For client side:
`>python socket-client.py {server_ip}`
such as:
`>python socket-client.py 192.168.1.35`

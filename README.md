I have tested server and client with a friend from Computer Engineering in Thai-Nichi Institute of Technology.<br>

### Requirements
- python version more than or equal 3<br>

### To use this protocol
Run socket-server.py on server side first<br>

For server side:<br>
in project directory<br>
`>python socket-server.py`
And wait for client side to communicate with you...<br>

For client side:<br>
`>python socket-client.py {server_ip}`
such as:<br>
`>python socket-client.py 192.168.1.35`
